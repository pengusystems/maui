# MAUI

This repository demonstrates work by **[Pengu Systems](www.pengusystems.com)**. It includes some HDL examples and work related to RADAR:
* [FMCW RADAR prototyping](./examples/fmcw_radar/) - MATLAB notebook for explaining the theory beyond fmcw radar used in cars
* [Pulsed RADAR prototyping](./examples/pulsed_radar/) - Vivado HLS project for experimenting with transmitting and reciving a modulated RADAR pulse
* [HDL examples](./examples/hdl/) - a small collection of headless HDL file examples
* [C++ serialport library based on asio](./examples/serialport/) - a cross platform library to interface a serial port. This can be built using [this script](./scripts/cpp/build_cpp_examples)
