This repository demonstrates work by **Pengu Systems**. It includes some HDL examples and work related to RADAR:
* [FMCW RADAR prototyping with MATLAB](./examples/fmcw_radar/) - MATLAB notebook for explaining the theory beyond fmcw radar used in cars
* [Pulsed RADAR prototyping with Vivado HLS](./examples/pulsed_radar/) - Vivado HLS project for experimenting with transmitting and reciving a modulated RADAR pulse
* [HDL examples](./src/examples/) - a small collection of headless HDL file examples
